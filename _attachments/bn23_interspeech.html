  Differential Privacy Enabled Dementia Classification: An Exploration of the
  Privacy-Accuracy Trade-off in Speech Signal Data

<p>Early detection of dementia is critical for effective symptom<br />
management. Recent studies have aimed to develop machine<br />
learning (ML) models to identify dementia onset and severity<br />
using language and speech features. However, existing methods can lead to serious privacy concerns due to sensitive data<br />
collected from a vulnerable population. In this work, we aim to<br />
establish the privacy-accuracy tradeoff benchmark for dementia<br />
classification models using audio and speech features. Specifically, we explore the effects of differential privacy (DP) on the<br />
training phase of the audio model. We then compare the classification accuracy of DP and non-DP models using a publicly<br />
available dataset. The resultant comparison provides useful insights to make informed decisions about the need for balancing<br />
privacy and accuracy tradeoff for dementia classification tasks.<br />
Our findings have implications for real-world deployment of<br />
ML models to support early detection and effective management of dementia.</p>
