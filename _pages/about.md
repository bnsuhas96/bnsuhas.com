    <h2>Hi, I'm Suhas!</h2>
    
    <p>I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon, passionate about building AI systems that actually help people. I recently wrapped up my Ph.D. in Informatics at Penn State, where I spent my time creating AI tools for mental health therapy - think synthetic therapy conversations and empathetic language models that can support PTSD treatment.</p>
    
    <p>What gets me excited? The intersection of technology and human wellbeing. Whether it's using speech signals to detect neurological conditions, building privacy-preserving depression assessment tools, or creating sensor networks to prevent train derailments in India, I love working on problems that matter.</p>

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me exploring my diverse interests:

- **Music**: Creating intricate rhythmic patterns on the mridangam (a South Indian percussion instrument) - I even had a performance aired on TV back in 2006!
- **Sports**: Playing cricket and watching football (huge Chelsea fan! ðŸ’™)
- **Photography**: Capturing landscapes and travel moments - [check out my work here](/photography/)
- **Speedcubing**: Solving Rubik's cubes quickly because why not?

I'm originally from Bangalore, India, and currently based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Always up for a good conversation about technology, research, football, or life in general!
