Hi, I'm Suhas!

I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon with a Ph.D. in Informatics from Penn State University. My doctoral research focused on **Generative Human-Centered AI for Mental Health**, where I developed novel synthetic data generation methods, privacy-preserving techniques, and automated clinical assessment tools for PTSD therapy. My work includes creating large-scale synthetic therapy datasets, developing empathetic small language models, and building automated fidelity tracking systems for clinical interventions. [[Ph.D. Thesis]](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/32981)

During my Ph.D., I interned at both Amazon and Samsung Research America, working on applied machine learning in healthcare. I also hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Penn State, with a focus on Signal Processing, where I developed privacy-preserving methods for assessing depression using speech signal processing. [[Master's Thesis]](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/23854), [[Slides]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-vZb9om8xlaRn_ZGYuTDahTpYzoma6pj/view?usp=sharing)

My interests include **Applied Machine Learning**, **Health Tech**, **Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing**, **Signal Processing**, **Algorithm Development**, and **Human-Centered AI**.

I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects, including using sensor networks to prevent train derailments and using audio signal processing to identify neurological disorders. [You can learn more about these projects here.](/research/)

I'm originally from Bangalore, India. In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, creating intricate rhythmic patterns on the mridangam, watching football (I'm a huge Chelsea fan!), taking landscape [photographs](/photography/), and speedcubing.

Feel free to reach out for collaborations or to exchange ideas in tech and health.
