I work at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, and **Healthcare**, developing AI systems that are both clinically meaningful and privacy-preserving.

## Research Highlights

- **Synthetic Therapy Data**: Created "Thousand Voices of Trauma" - 3,000 synthetic PTSD therapy conversations with clinical validation
- **Empathetic AI**: Developed TIDE dataset and fine-tuned small language models for trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue support  
- **Automated Clinical Assessment**: Built audio-language models for automatic temporal localization of therapy fidelity elements
- **Privacy-Preserving ML**: Pioneered federated learning approaches for depression assessment using speech data
- **Healthcare Applications**: Cuff-less blood pressure monitoring, speech-based neurological disorder detection

## Recognition & Fellowships

- **NSF NRT LINDIV Graduate Fellowship** (2022-2023)
- **Google CS Research Mentorship Program** (2022) 
- **Google Developers ML Bootcamp** (2022)
- **Penn State Graduate Student Travel Grant** ($1,000)
- **Best Poster Awards**: AI Week 2025 (3rd place), MASC-SLL (1st place)

## TS; WM

I graduated from PES University in Bangalore, India, with a B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering, specializing in Signal Processing, and a minor in Computer Science. My thesis focused on using wireless sensor networks to prevent train derailments in India, and I was fortunate to be advised by Gp Capt. (Retd.) Suresh Padmanabhan.

Our work caught the attention of Shri. Piyush Goyal, the current Hon'ble Minister for Railways in India, who mentioned our approach ([Building smarter (and safer) Indian Railways](https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/railways/building-a-smarter-indian-railways-piyush-goyal-highlights-7-projects-that-will-transform-rail-network/1297063/)) in his plans for improving railway safety throughout the country. We were also able to present our work at the [IEEE IC4 2018](https://doi.org/10.1109/CETIC4.2018.8531029) conference in Thiruvananthapuram, India.

I was lucky to have the opportunity to work at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore on a project sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology (DST, Govt. of India). The project aimed to use speech signal processing to identify neurological conditions such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. As part of my assistantship, I worked with patients at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), collecting and analyzing their speech samples. My advisor was [Dr. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/prasanta-kumar-ghosh/), and I have been able to publish our findings at conferences such as [INTERSPEECH 2019](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/abstracts/1285.html), [ICASSP 2020](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053682), and [SPCOM 2020](https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM50965.2020.9179503) (View the paper presentation video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v94UzLJoqQb-5WJRyxcWXZegIgHAcohf/view?usp=sharing)).

At Penn State, I have been fortunate to collaborate with researchers from different departments, including the School of EECS and the College of IST. For my [Master's thesis](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/23854), I worked with Dr. Saeed Abdullah to explore how federated learning can be used to preserve privacy while assessing depression. I was honored to have Dr. David Miller and Dr. Jing Yang serve on my thesis committee, and our paper on this work was accepted at [ICASSP 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746827)!
