    <h1>Hey there! 👋</h1>
    <h2>I'm Suhas</h2>
    
    <p class="tagline">Applied Scientist at Amazon • AI Researcher • Chelsea FC Fan</p>
    
    <p>I build AI systems that actually help people - from creating empathetic chatbots for PTSD therapy to using your voice to detect health conditions. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing cricket, creating rhythms on the mridangam, or capturing landscapes through my camera.</p>
