# Research Overview

I work at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, and **Healthcare**, developing AI systems that are both clinically meaningful and privacy-preserving.

## Research Highlights

- **Synthetic Therapy Data**: Created "Thousand Voices of Trauma" - 3,000 synthetic PTSD therapy conversations with clinical validation
- **Empathetic AI**: Developed TIDE dataset and fine-tuned small language models for trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue support  
- **Automated Clinical Assessment**: Built audio-language models for automatic temporal localization of therapy fidelity elements
- **Privacy-Preserving ML**: Pioneered federated learning approaches for depression assessment using speech data
- **Healthcare Applications**: Cuff-less blood pressure monitoring, speech-based neurological disorder detection

## Recognition & Fellowships

- **NSF NRT LINDIV Graduate Fellowship** (2022-2023)
- **Google CS Research Mentorship Program** (2022) 
- **Google Developers ML Bootcamp** (2022)
- **Penn State Graduate Student Travel Grant** ($1,000)
- **Best Poster Awards**: AI Week 2025 (3rd place), MASC-SLL (1st place)
