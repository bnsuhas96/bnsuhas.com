- **Empathetic AI**: Developed TIDE dataset and fine-tuned small language models for trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue support
- **Automated Clinical Assessment**: Built audio-language models for automatic temporal localization of therapy fidelity elements
- **Privacy-Preserving ML**: Pioneered federated learning approaches for depression assessment using speech data
- **Healthcare Applications**: Cuff-less blood pressure monitoring, speech-based neurological disorder detection
