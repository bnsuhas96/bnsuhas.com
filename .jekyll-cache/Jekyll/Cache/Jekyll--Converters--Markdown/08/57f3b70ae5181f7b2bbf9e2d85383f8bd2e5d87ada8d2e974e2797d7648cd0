<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Suhas!</p>

<p>I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon with a Ph.D. in Informatics from Penn State University. My doctoral research focused on <strong>Generative Human-Centered AI for Mental Health</strong>, where I developed novel synthetic data generation methods, privacy-preserving techniques, and automated clinical assessment tools for PTSD therapy. My work includes creating large-scale synthetic therapy datasets, developing empathetic small language models, and building automated fidelity tracking systems for clinical interventions. <a href="https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/32981">[Ph.D. Thesis]</a></p>

<p>During my Ph.D., I interned at both Amazon and Samsung Research America, working on applied machine learning in healthcare. I also hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from Penn State, with a focus on Signal Processing, where I developed privacy-preserving methods for assessing depression using speech signal processing. <a href="https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/23854">[Masterâ€™s Thesis]</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-vZb9om8xlaRn_ZGYuTDahTpYzoma6pj/view?usp=sharing">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>My interests include <strong>Applied Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Health Tech</strong>, <strong>Mobile &amp; Ubiquitous Computing</strong>, <strong>Signal Processing</strong>, <strong>Algorithm Development</strong>, and <strong>Human-Centered AI</strong>.</p>

<p>I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects, including using sensor networks to prevent train derailments and using audio signal processing to identify neurological disorders. <a href="/research/">You can learn more about these projects here.</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™m originally from Bangalore, India. In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, creating intricate rhythmic patterns on the mridangam, watching football (Iâ€™m a huge Chelsea fan!), taking landscape <a href="/photography/">photographs</a>, and speedcubing.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out for collaborations or to exchange ideas in tech and health.</p>
